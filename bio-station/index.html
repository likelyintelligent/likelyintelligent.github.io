			<h1>What are BioStations?</h1>
			BioStations are electric vehicle (EV) charging stations powered by food waste.
			<br><br>
			Research and development of BioStations technology is partially funded by a grant 
			from the National Science Foundation (NSF) and a contract with the Defense Advanced 
			Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

			<h1>Food Waste</h1>
			Between one-third to one-half of all food produced globally becomes food waste.  
			Most of this food is disposed into industrial trash compactors behind restaurants and grocery stores.
			Grocery stores produce an average 250kg of food waste per day.

			<h1>Is there enough energy in food waste?</h1>
			One pound of food waste is roughly equal to 2 million Joules of energy.
			To fully charge an average EV battery (60kWh) takes around 54 kg of biomass (1kg ~ 4 million Joules).
			<br><br>
			This is plenty energy to fully power several electric vehicles per day.
			However the BioStation technology is designed as a supplement to other sources of energy including
			solar and power grid.
